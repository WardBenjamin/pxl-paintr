#Notes

.to create a new file start the main program `pxlee.py` with the name of the file as an argument.. ie. `pxlee.py new_sprite`.

.you do not need to add an extension, pxl-paintr automatically saves your image as a 256 * 256 `.png` with alpha by default.

.be sure to save your scene as it will not prompt you to save.

.the interactive color picker on the right changes the color in the active selected palette!

.the status of the scene can be scene in the window header and updates in realtime.
